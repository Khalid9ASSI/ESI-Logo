# myScale - Quick SVG Icon Resizer
A *Small Lightweight Tool* scratched in Pure JavaScript and built within 2 Hrs with Bunch of Cookies :cookie: and Few Cups of Coffee :coffee: to resize and convert [SVG](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) to PNG Images on the go.

It enhanced a bit of productivity at Webkul HQ. So, Finally decided to Share it with the Community with better UI :grin: to save some of your minutes.
